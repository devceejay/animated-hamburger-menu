# Animated Hamburger Menu

This is an animated hamburger menu built with HTML and CSS created as part of my learning journey on CSS Animations

## What I Explored:

- Transitions: To make the menu feel more interactive and engaging
- @Keyframes: To transform the menu icon into a close icon dynamically
